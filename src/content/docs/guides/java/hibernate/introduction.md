- Hibernate is a robust, high-performance **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** framework for Java

- It bridges the gap between object-oriented domain models and relational databases. 
- It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database, 
- Eliminating the need for repetitive, error-prone SQL and JDBC code.

**Why Hibernate?**
- **Eliminates boilerplate JDBC code**: Automates CRUD operations, reducing development time
- **Provides database independence**: Write once, run on any database with minimal changes
- **Offers caching mechanisms**: First-level and second-level caching improve performance
- **Supports lazy loading**: Load data only when needed, optimizing memory usage
- **Handles transactions automatically**: Manages transaction boundaries and concurrency
- **Object-oriented query language**: HQL and Criteria API provide database-agnostic querying
