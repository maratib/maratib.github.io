## 9. Best Practices Summary

1. **Keep navigation structure simple** - Avoid deep nesting of navigators
2. **Use TypeScript** for better type safety with navigation params
3. **Implement deep linking** for better user experience
4. **Handle Android back button** appropriately for each screen
5. **Use navigation ref** for navigating from outside React components
6. **Optimize performance** with React.memo and useCallback where needed
7. **Test on both platforms** - iOS and Android have different navigation patterns
8. **Consider accessibility** with proper labels and navigation order
9. **Use consistent patterns** throughout your app
10. **Monitor navigation state** for debugging complex flows

## 10. Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Params not passing correctly** - Use TypeScript interfaces for route params
2. **Navigation nesting issues** - Keep navigation structure flat when possible
3. **Performance problems** - Use native stack for performance-critical parts
4. **Memory leaks** - Avoid storing large objects in navigation params
5. **Back button handling** - Use custom handlers where needed

This comprehensive guide should give you a solid foundation for implementing navigation in your React Native Expo projects. Remember to choose the navigation pattern that best fits your app's structure and user experience goals.
