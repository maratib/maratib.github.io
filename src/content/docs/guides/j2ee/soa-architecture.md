### üîπ Definition

* **SOA** is an **architectural style** where software is built as a collection of **loosely coupled, reusable services**.
* Each service performs a **specific business function** (e.g., payment processing, user authentication) and communicates through well-defined interfaces (protocols like SOAP, REST, JMS).

---

### üîπ Core Concepts

1. **Services**

   * Independent units of functionality (e.g., *Get Customer Details*).
   * Reusable across different applications.

2. **Loose Coupling**

   * Services don‚Äôt depend on internal details of each other ‚Äî only the contract/interface.

3. **Interoperability**

   * Services can interact regardless of platform/language (Java, .NET, Python).

4. **Service Contract**

   * Describes what the service does (via WSDL in SOAP, or OpenAPI/Swagger in REST).

5. **Discoverability**

   * Services can be registered and discovered by other applications (e.g., UDDI in classical SOA).

### üîπ Example

Imagine an **e-commerce system**:

* `OrderService` ‚Üí Place, track, cancel orders
* `PaymentService` ‚Üí Handle payments
* `ShippingService` ‚Üí Arrange delivery

They all work independently but **together form the business flow**.

### üîπ Check your knowledge


**What is SOA?**
- An architecture style that organizes software into reusable, loosely coupled services accessible over standard protocols.

**How SOA is different from Monolithic architecture?**

- SOA breaks applications into independent services communicating over standard protocols, while monolithic apps are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.

**What is the relationship between SOA and Microservices?**  
- Microservices are an evolution of SOA ‚Äî smaller, independently deployable, with lighter communication (REST/HTTP instead of SOAP/ESB).

**Difference between SOA and Microservices?**
- SOA uses coarse-grained services often connected via ESB, while Microservices are smaller, independently deployable, and typically use REST/HTTP.

**Why is loose coupling important?**
- It allows services to evolve independently, reduces dependencies, and increases flexibility.
