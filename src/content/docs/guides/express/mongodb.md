- MongoDB is a **document-oriented NoSQL database** designed for modern application development.
- Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tables with fixed rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- This approach allows for **natural data representation** that closely matches how developers think and code.

### Key Characteristics

- **Schema-less Design**: Documents in the same collection can have different structures
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Built for distributed computing environments
- **High Performance**: Optimized for read and write operations
- **Rich Query Language**: Powerful querying capabilities with support for complex operations
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Sophisticated data processing framework
- **Native Replication**: Automatic data redundancy and high availability

### MongoDB vs Relational Databases

## 2. Document Database Fundamentals

### BSON Format

MongoDB uses **BSON** (Binary JSON) as its data storage format. BSON extends JSON with additional data types and is optimized for:

- **Efficient encoding/decoding**
- **Traversability** - easier to parse
- **Additional data types** like Date, Binary, ObjectId, and more

### Document Structure

A MongoDB document is composed of **field-value pairs** similar to JSON objects:

- **Fields** are analogous to columns in relational databases
- **Values** can be various data types including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents
- **Documents have a unique `_id` field** that serves as the primary key

### Collections

Collections are the equivalent of tables in relational databases:

- **Group related documents** together
- **No enforced schema** - documents can have different structures
- **Dynamic creation** - created when first document is inserted
- **Capped collections** - fixed-size collections that maintain insertion order

### Data Types

MongoDB supports a rich set of data types:

- **Basic Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Null
- **Date Types**: Date, Timestamp
- **Binary Data**: BinData for storing files, images
- **ObjectId**: Special 12-byte identifier for documents
- **Arrays & Objects**: For storing complex, nested data
- **Geospatial**: Point, LineString, Polygon for location data

## 3. Core Architecture Concepts

### Storage Engine

The storage engine is responsible for:

- **Data persistence** on disk
- **Memory management**
- **Concurrency control**
- **Journaling** for crash recovery

MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, with **WiredTiger** being the default, offering:

- **Document-level concurrency control**
- **Compression** to reduce storage footprint
- **Checkpointing** for data consistency

### Database Structure

A MongoDB deployment is organized hierarchically:

- **Database**: Top-level container for collections
- **Collection**: Group of related documents
- **Document**: Basic unit of data storage
- **Field**: Key-value pair within a document

### Memory Architecture

MongoDB uses a **memory-mapped storage** approach:

- **Working Set**: Actively accessed data kept in RAM
- **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used algorithm manages memory
- **Journal**: Write-ahead log for durability
- **Oplog**: Operations log for replication

### Connection Handling

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses database connections
- **Cursors**: Handles large result sets efficiently
- **Write Concern**: Controls acknowledgment of write operations
- **Read Preference**: Determines where reads are directed in replica sets

## 4. Data Modeling Approaches

### Embedded Data Model

**Embedding** places related data in a single document structure. This is ideal for:

- **One-to-few relationships**
- **Data that's frequently accessed together**
- **Subdocuments that don't make sense alone**

**Advantages**:

- Single database read retrieves all related data
- Atomic writes within a document
- Better performance for read-heavy operations

**Disadvantages**:

- Large documents can exceed size limits (16MB)
- Can lead to data duplication
- Harder to query embedded fields independently

### Referenced Data Model

**Referencing** uses document links (references) to connect related data. This works well for:

- **One-to-many relationships**
- **Many-to-many relationships**
- **Large hierarchical data**
- **Frequently updated subdocuments**

**Advantages**:

- Smaller document sizes
- More flexible querying
- Better for write-heavy operations
- Avoids data duplication

**Disadvantages**:

- Requires multiple queries to retrieve complete data
- Application-level joins needed
- Potential for inconsistent data

### Hybrid Approach

Most real-world applications use a **combination** of embedding and referencing:

- **Embed frequently accessed data**
- **Reference less frequently accessed data**
- **Consider read/write patterns**
- **Account for data growth**

### Schema Design Patterns

1. **Attribute Pattern**: For fields with same value type but different meanings
2. **Bucket Pattern**: Grouping data into buckets (like time-series data)
3. **Computed Pattern**: Pre-computing frequently accessed values
4. **Subset Pattern**: Keeping frequently accessed subset of data in main collection
5. **Extended Reference Pattern**: Copying frequently accessed fields to avoid joins
6. **Approximation Pattern**: For expensive calculations, store approximations
7. **Tree Pattern**: For hierarchical data using materialized paths or nested sets

## 5. Query System & Operations

### CRUD Operations

**Create Operations**:

- **insertOne()**: Insert single document
- **insertMany()**: Insert multiple documents
- Implicit collection creation on first insert

**Read Operations**:

- **find()**: Query documents with filtering
- **findOne()**: Return single document
- **Projection**: Control which fields are returned
- **Cursor methods**: sort(), limit(), skip()

**Update Operations**:

- **updateOne()**: Update single document
- **updateMany()**: Update multiple documents
- **replaceOne()**: Replace entire document
- **Update operators**: $set, $inc, $push, $pull

**Delete Operations**:

- **deleteOne()**: Remove single document
- **deleteMany()**: Remove multiple documents
- **Drop operations**: Remove collections or databases

### Query Operators

**Comparison Operators**:

- **$eq, $ne**: Equal, Not equal
- **$gt, $gte**: Greater than, Greater than or equal
- **$lt, $lte**: Less than, Less than or equal
- **$in, $nin**: In array, Not in array

**Logical Operators**:

- **Query Shape**: The pattern of fields used in queries
- **Working Set**: Data actively being accessed

---

## 6. Aggregation Framework

### Pipeline Concept

The aggregation framework processes data through a **pipeline** of stages:

- Each stage **transforms** the documents
- Documents pass through stages **sequentially**
- Output of one stage becomes input to next
- **Early filtering** reduces data volume in later stages

### Common Pipeline Stages

**$match**: Filters documents (like WHERE in SQL)
**$group**: Groups documents by specified identifier
**$sort**: Sorts all input documents
**$project**: Reshapes each document (like SELECT in SQL)
**$limit**: Limits number of documents passed
**$skip**: Skips specified number of documents
**$unwind**: Deconstructs array fields
**$lookup**: Performs left outer join with another collection
**$facet**: Processes multiple pipelines within single stage

### Aggregation Operators

**Arithmetic Operators**: $add, $subtract, $multiply, $divide
**Array Operators**: $arrayElemAt, $concatArrays, $filter, $map
**Comparison Operators**: $cmp, $eq, $ne, $gt, $lt
**Conditional Operators**: $cond, $ifNull, $switch
**Date Operators**: $year, $month, $dayOfMonth, $hour
**String Operators**: $concat, $substr, $toLower, $toUpper
**Variable Operators**: $let, $map for expression handling

### Aggregation Strategies

- **Pipeline Optimization**: MongoDB reorders stages for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Large aggregations may use disk temporarily
- **Index Usage**: $match and $sort can use indexes
- **Sharding Considerations**: Early $match reduces cross-shard operations

## 7. Indexing Strategies

### Index Fundamentals

Indexes are **data structures** that improve query performance:

- **B-tree structure** for efficient range queries
- **Store partial copies** of data in optimized format
- **Trade storage space** for query performance
- **Maintained automatically** on write operations

### Index Types

**Single Field Index**: Index on a single field
**Compound Index**: Index on multiple fields
**Multikey Index**: Index on array fields
**Text Index**: For text search capabilities
**Geospatial Index**: For location-based queries
**Hashed Index**: For sharding and equality queries
**Partial Index**: Index only documents meeting filter expression
**Sparse Index**: Index only documents containing the indexed field
**TTL Index**: Automatically remove documents after specified time
**Unique Index**: Enforce uniqueness of field values

### Index Properties

**Collation**: Language-specific rules for string comparison
**Wildcard Indexing**: Support for querying arbitrary fields
**Hidden Indexes**: Temporarily disable indexes without dropping
**Index Builds**: Background vs foreground index creation

### Index Strategy

**ESR Rule**: For compound indexes, order fields by:

- **E**quality first
- **S**ort next
- **R**ange last

**Covering Queries**: Queries satisfied entirely by indexes
**Index Selectivity**: Choose indexes with high selectivity first
**Write Considerations**: Each index adds overhead to write operations
**Index Intersection**: MongoDB can use multiple indexes for single query

## 8. Replication & High Availability

### Replica Set Concept

A **replica set** is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set:

- **Automatic failover**
- **Data redundancy**
- **Distributed read operations**

### Replica Set Members

**Primary Node**:

- Receives all write operations
- Records operations in oplog
- Only one primary per replica set

**Secondary Nodes**:

- Replicate primary's data
- Can serve read operations
- Can become primary during failover

**Arbiter**:

- Doesn't hold data
- Votes in elections
- Breaks ties in voting

### Replication Process

1. **Oplog**: Primary records all operations in operations log
2. **Asynchronous Replication**: Secondaries copy and apply oplog entries
3. **Heartbeats**: Members monitor each other's status
4. **Elections**: Automatic primary election when primary becomes unavailable

### Read & Write Concerns

**Write Concern**:

- Controls acknowledgment level for write operations
- Can specify number of replicas that must acknowledge
- Balances durability vs performance

**Read Concern**:

- Controls consistency of read data
- Options: local, majority, linearizable
- Affects what data is visible to reads

**Read Preference**:

- Controls which replica set member handles reads
- Options: primary, primaryPreferred, secondary, secondaryPreferred, nearest
- Enables geographic load distribution

## 9. Sharding & Scalability

### Sharding Concept

**Sharding** is MongoDB's approach to horizontal scaling:

- **Partitions data** across multiple servers
- **Distributes load**
- **Enables massive scalability**

### Sharding Components

**Shard**: Individual MongoDB instance storing subset of data
**Config Servers**: Store cluster metadata and chunk information
**Mongos**: Router processes that direct operations to appropriate shards
**Chunk**: Contiguous range of shard key values (default 64MB-128MB)

### Shard Keys

The **shard key** determines how data is distributed:

- **Immutable** - cannot be changed after selection
- **Cardinality** - number of distinct values affects distribution
- **Frequency** - how often values occur affects distribution
- **Rate of Change** - monotonic keys can cause hotspotting

### Sharding Strategies

**Range-based Sharding**:

- Divides data into ranges based on shard key
- Good for range queries
- Risk of uneven distribution

**Hash-based Sharding**:

- Uses hashed shard key value
- Even data distribution
- Poor range query performance

**Zone Sharding**:

- Directs data to specific shards based on ranges
- Enables geographic distribution
- Manual chunk management

### Balancing Process

- **Balancer** automatically moves chunks between shards
- **Chunk Splitting** divides large chunks
- **Migration** moves chunks to balance data distribution
- **Jumbo Chunks** - chunks that cannot be split automatically
